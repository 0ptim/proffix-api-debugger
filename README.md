# Proffix API Debugger

A small, browser-based tool for testing and debugging requests against the Proffix REST API.

This project keeps things intentionally simple: the whole app lives in a single `index.html` file.

## What it includes

- Lightweight UI for manual API testing
- Tailwind CSS v4 (via browser runtime)
- Bootstrap Icons (via CDN)
- No build step

## Run it

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter your API details.
3. Send requests and inspect the responses.

## Notes

- This is an enhanced, cleaned-up take on the original Proffix debugger.
- Because it runs in the browser, behavior still depends on your API/CORS setup.
