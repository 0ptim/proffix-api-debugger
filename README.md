# Proffix API Debugger

Tiny, client-side, one-file debugger for developers working with the Proffix REST API.

It is an improved version of the original debugger provided by Proffix.

UI is styled with **Tailwind CSS v4** (browser runtime), while keeping the app as a single `index.html` file.

Open `index.html` in your browser and start testing API requests.
